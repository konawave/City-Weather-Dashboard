    // Validate entry. If not a valid city, alert that entry not valid.
// When I look up a city, I see City name, current date, and an icon representation of weather (API), temperature, humidity, windspeed. All in provided weather API.
    // If input === city, make entry visible.
// When I look at future dates, then I can see up to 5 days in advance that display all of the above info.
